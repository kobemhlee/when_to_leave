# when_to_leave

CS 4990 mobile app development project -- "When To Leave". As a commuter, leaving for school in the morning at the most optimal time is always stressful; traffic is always shifting, and is much worse on some mornings than others. Many times, I end up leaving either too early or too late from home because of these fluctuations. As a result, I have decided to create an app that would help remedy this issue. By taking in a user's schedule, and the locations of each of the items of that schedule, this app will notify the user "when to leave" from home by checking traffic conditions continuously. 

Dependencies utilized: provider, shared_preferences, geolocator: ^5.3.0, scheduled_notifications, and google_maps_flutter.
